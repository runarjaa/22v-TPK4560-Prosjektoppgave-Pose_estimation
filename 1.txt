Cw - Control Points in world
Xworld - Reference Points in world
U = image pixels
A = Camera Matrix
M = Matrix in Mx = 0
K = Smallest eigenvectors (last ones -> ones used in answer)
kernel - something similar i guess 
Km - subset of K

dimker = N in sum beta*n = x


sc = scaling?

L6_10 - L used in L*beta = rho

R = Rotation matrix
T = Translation vector
Rt = Transformation matrix

Cc = Control points in Camera
Xc = Reference Points in camera
